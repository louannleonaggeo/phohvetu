                            <p>Hi Guys, does anyone know if FO4 will support DirectX10? Minimum Cards listed have all DX11 Support Hi guys I'm having an issue with steam and I'm hoping someone can help me. I got a brand new laptop recently and its running Windows 10. Almost every game in my steam library runs fine but for some reason when I attempt to play Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, it does a first time directX installation (every time) and then it actually crashes the second I click on 'play'. ​ I tried running the launcher as admin and then I got an error message 'code execution cannot proceed because X3DAudio1\_.

Have others had similar things happen after updates? Also.just in case anyone knows a quick solution, the latest issue I built my first PC rig a couple of weeks ago, and Im getting low frames relative to the card itself, some are major, like 30 fps in crowded areas in fallout 4, and some are unnoticable such as topping out at 200 fps in csgo, one of the people I know said the problem might be that "the card was plugged into the PCIe 16x slot and not the second slot where it runs on Gen2 4x" Specs and Information Computer Information: Manufacturer: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd Model: MS-7C02 The Wine development release 3.21 is now available. ampnbsp; https://www.winehq.org/announce/3.21 ampnbsp; What's new in this release (see below for details): ampnbsp; - Typelib marshaller rewrite using NDR functions. - Graphics support on recent Android versions. - Support for memory font resources in DirectWrite. - Joystick support improvements. - Various bug fixes. ampnbsp; The source is available from the following locations: http://dl. I wrote a long detailed post about my experiences over the weekend but I decided to delete it because I won't have the time to be involved in lengthy arguments from both sides of the equation. So this is a shorter summary. I remember when I first decided to back the game in Summer 2015, but was met with harassment and attacks by the "fan" base because I was asking questions and voicing concern. Their actions convinced me not to put any money into the project until it was finished. This started around the patch released on January 10th and seems to only affect me - I asked other players present at the same SBQ fights and they had no problem. My issue is 100% reproduce-able - I essentially cannot participate in the SBQ fight any more. Shortly after the Scorchbeast Queen crawls out of her fissure the picture freezes but audio continues playing. Fallout 76's CPU utilization ramps up to ~70% and this carries on for a time ranging from a few seconds to however is long enough. 
Hi there, I've had this problem for a while now and I'm getting just a bit desperate. amp#x200B; I've got no sound whatsovever in several steam games, specifically Dark Souls III (no sound except intro, otherwise running fine), The Forest (no sound, no dynamite bug) and Fallout NV (no sound, running at about 5 fps). I just mentioned the bugs because it seems there are other things going on as well.

EDIT - 12/22/2018: I'm considering this a closed thread while I try to back up my data and reinstall Windows. If the problem persists, I'll reopen the topic. My laptop, when I got it, ran perfectly fine. My only gripes were that it didn't come with Bluetooth support and it only has 500GB of storage (or so they say). In the beginning, I downloaded too many games from Steam, and used lots of big software (ie. 3DS Max, Unity, trials of FL Studio Okay, guys, I'm on my last hope here.

I was going to get a new gpu to resolve the crash before loading issue but am not sure it is a GPU issue. Thoughts?

Happy to spend a few hours today running benches and posting results. Note - I'm not going to spend any (more) money buying games to benchmark, so stick to freely available stuff. I'm also not going to go to the trouble of setting up random cryptocoin wallets to test hash rates - if you have a standalone one-click benchmark for any of the crypto hashes, let me know. Edit, Dec 10 - Added list of broken benchmarks Don't close the post, but I have a 'gaming' laptop. I had to get a laptop because I move from the country to city almost every week, and it would be too much of a hassle to move a big PC with me every time. Please, if you are only here to educate me on my bad decision to buy a laptop, just skip.

Hello fellow Linux gamers! I'd like to start off by just saying how much I love what Wine/Proton and forums like these are doing to help advance games for Linux. Since I heard of the growth of Proton, I've been testing numerous games on it, most of which work better than they do on Windows. GTA V, DOOM, Fallout NV/4, and most others work absolutely amazingly. However, Call of Duty Infinite Warfare keeps throwing a fatal DirectX error each time I try to launch it under Proton. Someone in a video. My game continues to crash to the desktop, with no error. Sometimes I can play for hours before it crashes, sometimes 2 minutes. I've looked online but haven't found a solution yet.

So, like the title says, is this a known issue on the PC or am I just up poo creek? I hope I didn't waste 70 bucks here because I love Fallout and was really looking forward to playing this. 
Heya, this is my first time posting anything like this so sorry if I leave any important information out by accident. I have this problem where after a while of playing a game (usually Fallout 4, Skyrim Special Edition, or Ark: Survival Evolved) both of my monitors will suddenly go black and my speakers will make a buzzing sound. My specs are the following (copy/pasted from DxDiag): Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 17763) (17763.rs5\_release.180914-1434) Language: English. Trying to get my PC up to snuff, I was looking at the RX 580 but am not really sure what I need, or if it is the GPU only. I'm currently having an issue loading Fallout 4, I get to the splash page, after I press play is gives me a Windows error, says not responding, and closes. I've gone through all of the troubleshooting available online with no success. FYI I have a 256GB SSD Thanks!! Computer Information: Manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard Model: HP Z400 Workstation Form Factor: Deskto. Previously (11/26/18) I had a problem where, after changing my RAM and GPU, my Win 7 wouldn't start and froze at 'starting windows.' A friend came over to help and ended up putting Win 10 Pro on my computer. He authenticated it using a batch file in notepad. Now my Windows will actually start and I can sign in, but things still seem really off. At times I'll get a BSOD and I know I've seen at least three different ones. When I reinstalled Final Fantasy XIV, I'll crash randomly with DirectX. Hey Reddit! I'm looking into picking up parts for a new PC during this Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Boxing Day (sales depending). Been doing some research and looking around but this is a little outside of my wheelhouse. My goal is as close to 4k @ 60FPS gaming on High settings as could be available with existing tech. My current CPU and MOBO is 6+yrs old Display: Samsung 55" UHD HDR @ 60Hz Television OS: Windows 10 Home 64Bit Motherboard: Gigabyte Z68X-UD3H-B3. </p>
