Hello friends, here's the thing. i've had a 9550 for a year now and after many problems with it Dell has finally decided to replace the computer for a new one, i've asked for the 9560 but as a live in Argentina they cannot currently ship it here for the local policies. The thing is they are offering me the Precision 5520 (Specs detailed below) as a replacement, i cant decide if its better or worse for my everyday and id like you guys to help me find out.

Part of my new job's workflow requires xCode and some Macintosh utils to complete. I am looking for anything OS X compatible (Not sure if hackintoshes are done here, but if so I am OK with that too) that someone would be willing to trade for these keyboards. Here is some more info from my mechmarket post: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. I got a job in a company that only uses Edius as editing system and I can't get my head around why the made that decision. The key response is slow, it does not have (or I can't find) "basic" shortcuts and tools that other software have like no audio transitions if there is no other clip afterwards? WTF, I can't delete footage from the timeline bar until the next clip like in Avid and Premiere? 0_0. The whole thing is a mystery. Is there any Edius editor around here kind enough Since a couple if days I have noticed that my battery life has gone down. Before it would easily last a day, now I am luck if it does.
